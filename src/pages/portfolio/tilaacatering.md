[TilaaCatering] An online platform for catering services. Caterers using the service to find potential customers pay to access information of potential customers. I was in charge of the front-end implementation of the project which was built from bottom up using MERN stack. Stripe is used for payment and billing and I implemented it both in backend and frontend. **You can visit the site here:** [TilaaCatering]
